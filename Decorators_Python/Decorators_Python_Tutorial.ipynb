    "## What is a Decorator?\n",
    "\n",
    "A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends its behavior without explicitly modifying it. Decorators are a very powerful and useful tool in Python since they allow the modification of the behavior of a function or method in a declarative manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Wrapper Functions?\n",
    "The wrapper function in a decorator is critical for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolation of Enhancements: It isolates the enhancements or changes from the main logic of the function being decorated. This means that the original function does not get modified directly, which is important for maintaining clean and manageable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Behavior: The wrapper allows adding behavior both before and after the function call, which is not possible if you were to modify or replace the function directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: It enables the decorator to be used with any function, regardless of its parameters, which enhances flexibility and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preservation of Function Signatures: Using a wrapper ensures that the decorated function's signature is preserved, which is important for functions that might be used in contexts where specific arguments are expected."
